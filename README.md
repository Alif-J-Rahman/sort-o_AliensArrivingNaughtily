## BubbleSort

### Best Case:
* Array already sorted. Therefore, the algorithm will traverse the array, comparing adjacent values, until it reaches the second to last element and terminate since there were no swaps made. Therefore, it would take n-1 comparisons.
* Best-case time complexity: O(n).
### Worst Case:
* Array is in reverse chronological order. Therefore, the algorithm will traverse the array, comparing adjavent values, and swap. This process is then repeated for n-1 times and then the algorithm terminates. Therefore, it would take (n^2-n)/2 comparisons.
* Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2).

## SelectionSort

### Best Case:
* Selection Sort takes the same amount of comparaisons no matter the properties of the array. It always compares each element with every other element. Therefore, it would take (n^2-n)/2 comparisons.
* Best-case time complexity: O(n^2).
### Worst Case:
* Selection Sort takes the same amount of comparaisons no matter the properties of the array. It always compares each element with every other element. Therefore, it would take (n^2-n)/2 comparisons.
* Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2).

## InsertionSort

### Best Case:
* Array already sorted. Therefore, the algorithm will traverse the array, comparing adjacent values, and then terminate when no swaps are made. Therefore, it would take n-1 comparisons.
* Best-case time complexity: O(n).
### Worst Case:
* Array is in reverse chronological order. Therefore, the algorithm will have to compare each element with all every other element. Therefore, it would take (n^2-n)/2 comparisons.
* Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2).
